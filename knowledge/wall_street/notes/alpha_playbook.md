Playbook: Multi-market Alpha Principles
--------------------------------------

- Size by volatility and liquidity; cap per-trade risk as NAV %.
- Demand positive expected edge after fees/slippage; reject marginal trades.
- Prefer path-dependent strategies with clear stop and take-profit logic.
- Diversify sources: market making, momentum, relative value, carry, basis, funding.
- Continuous model monitoring; automatic degrade and disable on drawdown.
