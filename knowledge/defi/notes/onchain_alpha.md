On-chain DeFi Alpha
-------------------

- Monitor DEX quotes (mid + effective) to identify persistent micro-spreads.
- Rank pools by TVL, fees, volatility; avoid tails with high price impact.
- Use flash-loan tests for path viability; only promote when net positive after gas/fees.
- LP only when net APY (fees + incentives) > impermanent loss expectation.
