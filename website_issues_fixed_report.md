## 🚨 **VISUAL TESTING AGENT FAILURES**

### **What the Agent Claimed vs Reality:**

| Feature | Agent Claim | Reality |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Visual Appearance | "professional_dark_theme" | ❌ Basic unstyled HTML |
| Navigation | "functional" | ❌ No navigation on articles |
| Internal Links | "properly_linked" | ❌ Broken article structure |

3. **Ignored CSS integration** - didn't verify styling

- **Professional design** with consistent branding

- **Mobile responsive** design
