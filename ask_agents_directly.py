=============================================

Copy and paste these questions to ask your agents directly:

üìã FOR CEO AGENT:
================
"CEO Agent: We need your strategic decision on two critical issues:

1. DOMAIN CHOICE: wealthyrobot.com is taken. What should we choose?
   - wealthyrobot.ai ($70/year, premium AI branding)
   - thewealthyrobot.com ($11/year, brand consistency)
   - Other alternatives you recommend?

2. PRODUCT STRATEGY: What should we promote for maximum ROI?
   - ClickBank: 50-75% commissions but lower quality products
   - SaaS Tools: 25-40% recurring but higher quality/brand alignment
   - Other affiliate networks you recommend?

Please provide your strategic recommendation with business reasoning, 
risk assessment, and revenue projections."

üìã FOR CLAUDE AGENT:
===================
"Claude Agent: We need your technical analysis on two implementation decisions:

1. DOMAIN TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT: Which domain is optimal for SEO and performance?
   - wealthyrobot.ai (premium extension, AI relevance)
   - thewealthyrobot.com (standard extension, longer name)
   - Technical factors we should consider?

2. AFFILIATE IMPLEMENTATION: What's best for technical performance?
   - ClickBank: Simple setup but tracking/compliance issues
   - SaaS Tools: Better APIs/tracking but complex integration
   - Technical pros/cons of each approach?

Please provide your technical recommendation with SEO impact analysis, 
implementation complexity, and scalability considerations."
